# Computer Vision
In this Computer Vision Repository I have upload five projects Related to Computer vision which I have made. The following project is 1.Face Recognition with Emotion capture using Open CV, 2.Real Time Object Recognition using Single Shot Detection (SSD). 3. Image Creation with Deep Convolutional GANs. 4. MNIST-Handwritten-Digits-Recognition-Using-Deep-Neural-Network 5.CIFAR 10 Object Recognition in Images Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network. These are project which I have done.

## Project 1: Face Recognition with Emotion capture using Open CV
In this project I made face Recognition using open CV Libraries. Basically these face Detection projects detect your face with Green Rectangle eyes with Blue Detection and Red Rectangle detect Smile face which your face make a smile. I use haarcascade_eye for detecting eyes, haarcascade_frontalface_default for face detection and haarcascade_smile for detect smile face.

## Project 2: Real Time Object Dectection using Single Shot Dectection(SSD)
In this project I made detection system which detects the real time objects. I use Single Shot Detection (SSD) and Open CV in this project. SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) is a popular algorithm in object detection. It's generally faster than Faster RCNN. I use randomly 2 second video and apply our model on it it’s detect the everything (objects) in video with rectangle and specify with name.

## Project 3: Image Creation with Deep Convolutional GANs
In this project create a fake images from real image using Deep Convolutional GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) .For creating new images from real image we use CIFAR-10 dataset. In this project we pytorch library and build a model (Generator & Discriminator) from scratch. During training a model I run only one number of epoch because I am student I can’t have complete source to run this model for maximum  number of epochs because It’ required high level system to run this model which I can’t offered. I run only one number of epochs and achieved more than 80% accuracy.
